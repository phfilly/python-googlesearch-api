Quick little python application which pulls the google trends data (interest over time and interest by region) and displays it in an two easy to read charts.

I do not have a lot of experience in Python so do feel free to contribute/criticize.

# How to use

1. Run in the command line with `flask run`
2. Try using the /trends/YOUR TERM HERE to retrieve your trending data _only_ currently supporting (interest over time and interest by region)
3. Loading the homepage you will see the top google searches for your specified term. For example: `http://localhost/Star Wars`
